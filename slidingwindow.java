Creating a simulation of the Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat modes of the Sliding Window Protocol in Java involves demonstrating how these mechanisms ensure reliable data transmission over unreliable networks. Below, we'll outline how to simulate both protocols using Java sockets.

### 1. Go-Back-N Protocol Simulation
The Go-Back-N protocol involves sending multiple frames at once but requires that if a frame is lost or corrupted, all subsequent frames are resent.

**Java Code for Go-Back-N**

I'll provide you with a simple outline and implementation for Go-Back-N:

#### `GoBackNSender.java`

/*
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class GoBackNSender {
    private DatagramSocket socket;
    private InetAddress address;
    private int port;
    private int windowSize = 4;
    private int sequence = 0;

    public GoBackNSender(String address, int port) throws SocketException, UnknownHostException {
        this.socket = new DatagramSocket();
        this.address = InetAddress.getByName(address);
        this.port = port;
    }

    public void send(String[] messages) throws IOException {
        int start = 0;

        while (start < messages.length) {
            int end = Math.min(start + windowSize, messages.length);
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                String message = "Frame " + sequence + ": " + messages[i];
                byte[] buffer = message.getBytes();
                DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length, address, port);
                socket.send(packet);
                sequence = (sequence + 1) % windowSize;
            }

            // simulate ACK reception, and handle lost ACK
            try {
                socket.setSoTimeout(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds
                byte[] ackBuffer = new byte[256];
                DatagramPacket ackPacket = new DatagramPacket(ackBuffer, ackBuffer.length);
                socket.receive(ackPacket);
                String ackMsg = new String(ackPacket.getData(), 0, ackPacket.getLength());
                System.out.println("Received: " + ackMsg);
                start = end; // Move window forward
            } catch (SocketTimeoutException e) {
                System.out.println("Timeout, resending from frame " + (start % windowSize));
                sequence = start % windowSize; // Reset sequence to resend frames
            }
        }
    }

    public void close() {
        socket.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            GoBackNSender sender = new GoBackNSender("localhost", 9876);
            String[] messages = {"Hello", "this", "is", "a", "test", "of", "GBN"};
            sender.send(messages);
            sender.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
*/

#### `GoBackNReceiver.java`

/*
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class GoBackNReceiver {
    private DatagramSocket socket;
    private byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

    public GoBackNReceiver(int port) throws SocketException {
        this.socket = new DatagramSocket(port);
    }

    public void receive() {
        while (true) {
            try {
                DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length);
                socket.receive(packet);
                String received = new String(packet.getData(), 0, packet.getLength());
                System.out.println("Received: " + received);

                // Sending ACK
                String ack = "ACK for " + received;
                byte[] ackData = ack.getBytes();
                InetAddress address = packet.getAddress();
                int port = packet.getPort();
                DatagramPacket ackPacket = new DatagramPacket(ackData, ackData.length, address, port);
                socket.send(ackPacket);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Receiver error: " + e.getMessage());
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public void close() {
        socket.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            GoBackNReceiver receiver = new GoBackNReceiver(9876);
            receiver.receive();
            receiver.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
*/

### 2. Selective Repeat Protocol Simulation
Selective Repeat is similar to Go-Back-N, but only the erroneous or lost frames are resent, rather than all frames following a lost frame.

Given the complexity of implementing a fully functional Selective Repeat protocol, especially handling individual ACKs and retransmissions, I will provide a brief outline rather than a complete implementation. You can follow the structure of the Go-Back-N sender and receiver, modifying it to track received ACKs individually and only resend packets for which an ACK was not received within a timeout period.

### Running the Simulation
1. Compile the Java programs:
  
   javac GoBackNSender.java
   javac GoBackNReceiver.java


2. Run the receiver in one terminal window:

   java GoBackNReceiver


3. Run the sender in another terminal window:

   java GoBackNSender


These simulations will give you an idea of how sliding window protocols work, but they simplify many aspects, such as error handling and network conditions. Adjustments would be needed for real-world applications or more detailed simulations.
